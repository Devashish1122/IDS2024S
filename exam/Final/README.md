2. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. some of the aesthetics are size, color, line width, etc.   
3. the second one is more appropriate.   
4. a - qualitative data scale. , b - sequential data scale. , c - diverging color scale , d - accenet color scale.

16.    
17.
