2) Local, centralized, and Distributed version controlling system.   
3) Distributed is the best Version Control system out of three. This is because systems dont require remote server communication, code can be quickly

4) a) Git pull - Fetch form and integrates with another repository or a local branch.  
   b) Git status - This allows one to check the status of our Git project.  
   c) Git add --all - It adds all the file including modified and deleted files without the newly-created files.    
   d) Git commit -m"latest build" -It acts as an shortcut to first automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted and then commit them to the repository, and the 'm' helps us to enter any short message written after the  inverted commas, on the command line as the log message of the commit.   
5)  1) this is the website for my github account (https://devashish1122.github.io).  
    2) Hyperext transfer protocol secure is the secure version of http, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a 
       website.  
    3) An absolute path is the complete address of a file or a directory starting at a file system root.      
       A realtive path refers to the location of a file or a directory relative to the current working directory.
