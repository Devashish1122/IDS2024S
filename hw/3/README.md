1) The Three pillars of science are Experiment, Theory, and Computation + Data.  
2) The three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are Bioinformatics / Biophysics, Biomedical Data Science, and Traffic Engineering.   
3) The two type of Scientific reasoning are Deductive and plausible reasoning.  
   Deductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we would like to use all the time; but, in almost all real world situations confronting us we do not have the right kind of information to allow this kind of reasoning. Therefore, we must often use weaker logical argument.  
ex- A - All mammals are warm-blooded;  
    B - Dogs are mammals.  
For Plausible reasoning, The evidence does not prove that A is true, but verification of one of its consequences does
give us more confidence in A.  
ex - A - it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest;  
   B - the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.
