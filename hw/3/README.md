1) The Three pillars of science are Experiment, Theory, and Computation + Data.  
2) The three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are Bioinformatics / Biophysics, Biomedical Data Science, and Traffic Engineering.   
3) The two type of Scientific reasoning are Deductive and plausible reasoning.  
   Deductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we would like to use all the time; but, in almost all real world situations confronting us we do not have the right kind of information to allow this kind of reasoning. Therefore, we must often use weaker logical argument.  
ex- A - All mammals are warm-blooded;  
    B - Dogs are mammals.  
For Plausible reasoning, The evidence does not prove that A is true, but verification of one of its consequences does
give us more confidence in A.  
ex - A - it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest;  
   B - the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.  
4) Here we can use deductive reasoning, . 'A' establishes a general principle that individuals engaged in exiting a jewelry store through a broken window with stolen goods are likely involved in a burglary. 'B' provides specific information about the gentleman's actions, confirming that he fits the criteria described in the first premise. Thus, based on deductive reasoning, the conclusion is drawn that the gentleman is likely dishonest and involved in the burglary.  
5)  If someone is exiting through a broken window of a store outside business hours and is carrying a bag from inside, then it is likely they are removing items without permission. So lets suppose A as policemen hearing the burglar alarm and B to be the person crawling out of the broken window carrying a bag full of jewelery. If A is true policemen assumes that something is wrong with the store and there is an theft occuring over there. And B could be the reasoning for the policemen to make sure that the person crawling out to be an dishonest person.
