2)ENIAC stands for "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer."   
  
3) In computers, everything is shown using whole numbers because the electronic parts inside can only understand two states: on and off, which are represented as 0 and 1. This binary system is easy for computers to work with.    
4) The quickest part of a computer's memory is called the CPU cache.   
5) The slowest storage device inside a computer, which is usually built into it, is a hard disk drive (HDD).    
6) The smallest piece of information in computer science is called a bit.  
7) (a) Assembly language is the closest programming language to machine code.  
   (b) Yes, it does needs interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible.  
8) (a) Fortan is said to be the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.        
   (b) Fortan was created in 1950s, So it around 7 decades old.  
9) (a) the sole language of second generation is Assembly.  
   (b) C,C++ and Fortran are the third generation language, While MATLAB, Python, and R are the Fourth generation language.  
10) C and MATLAB were created in 1970s, and C++ and Python were created in 1980s.  
11) 'B' is the ancestor of C.  
12) 'C' is the ancestor of C++.  
13) 'ABC' is the ancestor of python, and 'Fortan' is the ancestor of MATLAB.  
14) CPU cache is the fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers.  
15) bit.  
16) fdd  
17) It is much faster compared to SSD hard drives but, the exact speed difference can vary depending on specific hardware configurations and technologies.  
18) The exact speed difference can vary depending on specific hardware configurations and technologies, but RAM access is generally thousands to tens of thousands of times faster than accessing data from HDDs.  
19) The three basic role of the transistor are:  
 Base: The base controls whether current is allowed to flow through the transistor when power is applied.  
Collector: When there is the power to the base, the collector current is allowed to flow toward the emitter.  
Emitter: The emitter takes the electric current that the collector is allowed to send to be used on other parts of your circuit.  
20) yes it is true but there can be more limitation such as more power consumption and generation of more heat.  
21) The three task accomploished by the CPU cycle are fetch, decode, and execute.
22) yes, it can be slower then slow CPU cycle because it would be having an higher clock speed.  
23) Yes, a powerful computer with more CPU cycles can be slower than a computer with less CPU cycles.  
24) 
Dennard Scaling: Refers to the trend where as transistors become smaller, their power density remains constant, allowing for faster and more efficient chips.  

MOSFET Scaling: Involves shrinking the size of MOSFETs to increase transistor density and improve performance, efficiency, and cost.  

Moore's Law: An observation stating that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power and performance.  
25)     
1) 64.  
2) we would need 2080 grains.   
3) 0.2971 pounds.  
26)
