2)ENIAC stands for "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer."   
  
3) In computers, everything is shown using whole numbers because the electronic parts inside can only understand two states: on and off, which are represented as 0 and 1. This binary system is easy for computers to work with.    
4) The quickest part of a computer's memory is called the CPU cache.   
5) The slowest storage device inside a computer, which is usually built into it, is a hard disk drive (HDD).    
6) The smallest piece of information in computer science is called a bit.  
7) (a) Assembly language is the closest programming language to machine code.  
   (b) Yes, it does needs interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible.  
8) (a) Fortan is said to be the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.        
   (b) Fortan was created in 1950s, So it around 7 decades old.  
9) (a) the sole language of second generation is Assembly.  
   (b) C,C++ and Fortran are the third generation language, While MATLAB, Python, and R are the Fourth generation language.  
10) C and MATLAB were created in 1970s, and C++ and Python were created in 1980s.  
11) 'B' is the ancestor of C.  
12) 'C' is the ancestor of C++.  
13) 'ABC' is the ancestor of python, and 'Fortan' is the ancestor of MATLAB.  
14) The 3 common types of error in computer programming are: syntax error, runtime error, and semantic error.  
15) A memory leak is a type of resource management error.
