1) the very first thing in scientific infrence is observational data which are the past records or data of any event. The second thing is model construction, calibration and validation. So, from the second step we construct the model from the given observational data and we try to explain the situation. The third step is prediction in which we predict the outcome of the event. The fourth step is the natural phenomenon in which we get the result of our prediction the natural phenomenon is the event we discussed about and further this information is stored as an observational data for any upcomning event.
2) The Three pillars of science are Experiment, Theory, and Computation + Data.
3) a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction.    
   also can be used as an substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available.    
   it is even a substitute for theory, where it is not available.
4) The two different types of Scientific reasoning are Deductive and plausible reasoning.  
  - Plausible reasoning - The evidence does not prove that A is true, but verification of one of its consequences does give us more confidence in A.  
ex - (i) - it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest;  
     (ii) -  sky will be cloudy before 10 am.  
Deductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we would like to use all the time; but, in almost all real world situations confronting us we do not have the right kind of information to allow this kind of reasoning. Therefore, we must often use weaker logical argument.    
ex- (i) - All mammals are warm-blooded;   
    (ii) - Dogs are mammals.   
5) logical implication and physical causation are NOT the same. The premise ‘if A then B’ expresses B only as a logical consequence of A; and not necessarily a causal physical consequence, which could be effective only later. The rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am.
Nevertheless, the proper logical connection is not in the uncertain causal direction(clouds ⇒ rain), but rather (rain ⇒ clouds), which is certain, although noncausal.  
6) Boolean algebra is named after George Boole.   
9) if the two Boolean proportions are equal (ex- A=B), Then the truth value of the variable in left hand side would be similar to the value of variable at the left hand side.  
16) Suppose we have the following special functions that are TRUE only at specific points within the logical sample space, we can wrtite the function as f1(A,B)+f3(A,B)+f4(A,B) as AB + A'B + A'B' which is why it is equivalent to logical implication A⇒B.
18) On my opinion this quiz was a lot harder for me because i was not present at the class on the week when this part was being studied. the first few questions were easy for me because i was present at that time but i struggled a lot for venn diagram and truth table because i was not present at the last 2 lectures.
