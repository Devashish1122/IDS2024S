8)  qualitative color scale: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.   
  Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, of speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.   
  In some cases, we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. in this case we use diverging color scale.  
  Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data. this can be done through accent color scale.
