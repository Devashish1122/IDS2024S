this file contains my quiz 5.  
1) All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. some of them are position, shape, size, line width, etc.   
2) continuous and discrete.   
3) Variables holding qualitative data are factors , and the different categories of the same are called levels.
4) he two types of data are quantitaive and qualitative.
5) categorial.
6) ordered - size, width, area. unordered - shape, colour, style.  
7) Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature, such that data values at one end of the scale can be logically
joined to data values at the other end.  
8)  qualitative color scale: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.    
  Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, of speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.   
  In some cases, we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. in this case we use diverging color scale.    
  Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data. this can be done through accent color scale.  
9) Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations because the 3D plots are very difficult to read and when we see them from different angles it tends to be different.
10) tt
11) color is an categorical and unordered aestheics.
12) the second one which is drawn with black.
13) the very first one is the correct answer.
14)
